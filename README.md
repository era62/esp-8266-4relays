It's a simple sketch to use your esp8266 ideaspark with Blynk. A good starting point to create your own sketch. It can change 
the status of four different ports (D0, D1, D2, D3) via Wifi cloud using four virtual pins (V0, V1, V3, V4).
The status of the ports is shown, of course, on the display.
Just create your widget with the android or ios app Blynk. The use of D0 as output is not recommended, but it works fine for me.
Use it to control relays, leds, or every other need.
Have fun! Pupazzino1 on IG.
